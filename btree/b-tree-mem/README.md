#### In memory B-Tree implementation in Go.

This is a simple in-memory B-Tree implementation in Go. It is not meant to be used in production, but rather as a
learning tool.

It's an implementation of the B-Tree described
in [Introduction to Algorithms](http://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046305/introduction-to-algorithms/) book.
