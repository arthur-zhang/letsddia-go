# Run Length Encoding

Run Length Encoding (RLE) is a simple data compression algorithm, primarily aimed at reducing the storage space for consecutive repetitive data. It is highly effective when handling data sets that contain a substantial amount of repetitive elements, such as certain types of images, audio, and video data.

The principle behind RLE involves representing consecutive occurrences of the same element (referred to as a "run") as a pair of data: the element itself and the count of its consecutive occurrences. This mode of compression can significantly cut down the volume of data that needs to be stored.

For instance, let's consider the following data sequence:

```
AAAAAABBBBCCCCC
```

When compressed using RLE, this sequence would be represented as:

```
6A4B5C
```

This implies that "A" is repeated 6 times, "B" is repeated 4 times, and "C" is repeated 5 times. Evidently, the compressed data is much less than the original data.

However, it's crucial to note that RLE doesn't always provide optimal compression. If the data doesn't contain a large amount of consecutive repetitive elements, RLE might, in fact, enlarge the data. For instance, the sequence "ABCDEF", when compressed using RLE, might turn into "1A1B1C1D1E1F", which is larger than the original data.

Despite this, RLE can still offer excellent compression for certain types of data. Particularly when handling data with a lot of consecutive repetitive elements, RLE is a straightforward and effective compression method.
